A web application consisting of a 10x10 board of X's and O's. Clicking on a square toggles it. The neat thing is that the state of the board is persistent and updates in real time if other people viewing the page change it.

Run it with:
$ cd erlang/weg-game-stuff
$ erlc *.erl
$ erl
1> gamemain:main().

It listens on port 8000.

The dependencies are Erlang and Yaws.
